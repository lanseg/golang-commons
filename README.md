# Reinventing the wheel

Reinventing the wheel could be one of the most and easy ways to get used to a new language
and that's what I'm doing here. Of course, there are dozens of libraries doing the same I'm
doing here, but it's still a good practice and could be usable. 

Here you can find
* Collections - filtering, modifying, grouping or doing other operations with slices
* Optionals - helps to avoid all that ``` if err != nil { return err } ```
* Common - just random utilities: ifnull, logging, uuid generation, etc.

Of course, if copy/paste is perfectly fine!
